## Angel Flight Bookings

Angel Flight is a charitable organization that arranges free air transportation for individuals in need of medical treatment, particularly those residing far from specialized healthcare facilities. These flights are coordinated by volunteers and pilots who donate their time and resources to help patients access necessary medical care.

Several MAG members participate in Angel Flights.

This can mean that different MAG members are bidding for the same flight and therefore can be in need of the same aircraft.

I understand this has not been a problem but as more people become involved it is possible that some agreed conventions on booking procedures may assist in avoiding misunderstandings.

A zoom meeting has been organised for Tuesday the 6th of August at 7:30pm for discussion on the topic. Anyone wishing to participate is welcome and can register by emailing Bill Holmes.
