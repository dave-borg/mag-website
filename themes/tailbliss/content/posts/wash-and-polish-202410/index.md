## October Wash and Polish

Great turnout at the October Wash & Polish. Glorious spring morning down at Moorabbin to give OKY and DKC a good clean. It was great to see some new faces and meet some of the new members Cameron and James. And as always it's great to see some of the veteran members as well. 

Thanks everyone again for leaning in, and thnx once again to Mark for organising.
