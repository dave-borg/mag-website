The May newsletter reported that there would be a push to repair the ailing autopilot during the 100 hourly service which was successful. There have been some problems reported with the Aspen however we are hopeful the aircraft will remain serviceable until the time when it goes in for the dashboard upgrade.

The project manager for the OKY upgrade, Rolf Blomstedt, led the specification and tender evaluation process for the upgrade. The contract to do the upgrade has been awarded to Avionics 2000 located at Essendon. Rolf will continue to be the key contact with the contractor throughout the upgrade.

All of the new electronics has now been received into store and has been paid for thanks to the share call. The current plan is for OKY to come off line on the 11th of November. The contractor has previously advised that the upgrade will take around six weeks. The date and the length of the work may need to change as detailed planning may reveal other constraints.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
