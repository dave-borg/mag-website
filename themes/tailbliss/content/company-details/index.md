## Company Valuation

It is entirely up to the buyer and seller to agree on the value of a share in MAG. But here are a few items worth considering:

- There are 38 equal shares in MAG. This is stipulated in the company constitution and is unlikely to change.
- The assets of the company are the two aircraft and cash on hand which is largely set aside for aircraft maintenance. These appear on the company balance sheet in the Annual Financial Statement
- Each member shareholder is responsible to pay an annual levy that covers ongoing costs such as insurance, YMMB parking and access, Airservices contracts etc...
- Occasionally members are asked to contribute funds to a share call in order to upgrade or replace an aircraft
- It is important to agree on how any unpaid levies, share calls or flying accounts are to be paid
