# Share Purchase Process

## Introduction
Welcome to our guide on purchasing shares within our organization. This overview will walk you through the process, whether you're an existing pilot or a new member looking to join. We aim to make this as clear and straightforward as possible.

## General Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Contact
- **Seller**: Reach out to the Chairman or Secretary to check if there's a waiting list of interested buyers and to get the latest share sale price.
- **Buyer**: Contact the Chairman or Secretary to find out if there are shares available for purchase or if there's a waiting list.

### Step 2: Registering Interest
- **If there’s a waiting list**: The seller will receive the email addresses of potential buyers.
- **If no waiting list**: 
  - Sellers can list their intent to sell with the Secretary.
  - Buyers will be provided with contact details of sellers who have shares available.

### Step 3: Marketing Shares
If there is no waiting list, the seller can advertise their shares through other means, like aviation magazines.

## For Non-Members

### Step 4: Agreement and Documentation
Once an agreement is reached:
- The seller informs the Secretary of the buyer’s details and the agreed sale price.
- The Secretary will send the buyer:
  - **Share Transfer Form**
  - **Service Agreement**
  - **New Member Entry Form**
  - **Engineering Papers**
  - **Previous Year’s Financial Report**

### Step 5: Preparing for the Purchase
- **Buyer**: Review and complete the necessary forms and agreements.
- **Seller**: Receive a reconciliation statement from the Secretary for any outstanding dues.

### Step 6: Familiarisation Flight
- The buyer arranges a familiarisation flight with a nominated Flight Instructor.
- The buyer submits the completed Engineering Paper to the Instructor before the flight.
- If the flight is successful, the Instructor signs the New Member Entry Form.

### Step 7: Completing the Transaction
- The buyer and seller finalize the share transfer and submit the necessary documents to the Secretary.
- The buyer pays the joining fee, check flight cost, and any applicable levies.

### Step 8: Final Approval
Once all documents and payments are received:
- The buyer is officially recognized as a shareholder and authorized to fly MAG aircraft.
- The Share Transfer Form is stamped, and the ASIC share register is updated.

## For Supernumerary Members

### Step 4: Documentation
- The Secretary sends the buyer a Share Transfer Form with details of the sale procedure.
- The buyer completes the form and settles any remaining balance with the seller.

### Step 5: Finalizing the Transfer
- The seller completes their portion of the Share Transfer Form and returns it to the Secretary.
- The Secretary processes the transfer, updates the ASIC share register, and officially welcomes the buyer as a shareholder.
